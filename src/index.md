          Hello! I am a graphic designer based in New York City. I was raised and born in Ukraine and moved to the US in 2014. I am currently a student at Borough of Manhattan Community College, where I study Multimedia Programming and Design. My goal is to gain new skills and experiences to create engaging integrated concepts and innovative designs.
